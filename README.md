Roku client that allows you to monitor your Native ROKU or Bitmovin Player playback with [Bitmovin Analytics](https://bitmovin.com/video-analytics)

## Getting started

### Analytics license setup

Choose a Bitmovin Analytics license from the [Bitmovin dashboard](https://bitmovin.com/dashboard/analytics/licenses).
Make sure that Your domain (channel id) is in the allow-list and postfixed with `.roku`.
During local development the domain will be `dev.roku`.
A random channel id will be assigned once your channel is released. Update the allow-list in the dashboard accordingly.
This step is essential to enable analytics data collection.

Configure the license key in the `manifest` file located in the root folder of the project:

```bash
# Analytics license key
bitmovin_analytics_license_key=INSERT_LICENSE_KEY_HERE
```

Or set it in the Bitmovin Analytics configuration object:

```javascript
analyticsConfig = {
  key: "INSERT_LICENSE_KEY_HERE",
  title: "Your Video Title",
  videoId: "your-video-id",
}
```

## Bitmovin player collector

Bitmovin analytics collector for monitoring Bitmovin player playback.

### Basic use

Copy `collectorCore` and `bitmovinPlayerCollector` folders into Your project.

In order to use the collector, first create a Bitmovin player collector object:

```javascript
m.bitmovinPlayerCollector = CreateObject("roSgNode", "bitmovinPlayerCollector")
```

To set up Bitmovin Analytics and start monitoring the player, call `initializeAnalytics` with the analytics configuration, and then the `initializePlayer` with the Bitmovin player object as an argument.
This must happen before the `setup` function is called on the Bitmovin player.

```javascript
m.bitmovinPlayerCollector.callFunc("initializeAnalytics", analyticsConfig)
m.bitmovinPlayerCollector.callFunc("initializePlayer", m.bitmovinPlayer)
```

## Native player collector

Bitmovin analytics collector for monitoring native ROKU player playback.

### Basic use

Copy `collectorCore` and `nativePlayerCollector` folders into Your project.

In order to use the collector, first create a native player collector object:

```javascript
m.nativePlayerCollector = CreateObject("roSgNode", "nativePlayerCollector")
```

To set up Bitmovin Analytics and start monitoring the player, call `initializeAnalytics` with the analytics configuration, and then the `initializePlayer` with the native player object as an argument.
This must happen before any content is set on the ROKU native player:

```javascript
m.nativePlayerCollector.callFunc("initializeAnalytics", analyticsConfig)
m.nativePlayerCollector.callFunc("initializePlayer", m.nativePlayer)
```

## Optional configuration parameters for Bitmovin Analytics

Several other fields can be added to the Bitmovin Analytics configuration in order to improve data collection:

```javascript
analyticsConfig = {
  videoId: "videoId1234",
  customUserId: "customUserId1",
  cdnProvider: "CDNProvider",
  experimentName: "experiment-1",
  customData1: "customData1",
  customData2: "customData2",
  customData3: "customData3",
  customData4: "customData4",
  customData5: "customData5",
  heartbeatInterval: 59700, // value is in ms
}
```

## Development

### How to run the tests

If you have not done so, do an `npm install` at this point. This will also install the `Rooibos-cli` preprocessor.
Rooibos-cli is a preprocessor tool that rooibos unit testing framework use in order to preprocess the files needed to run the tests.

Next step is copying of `collectorCore`, `nativePlayerCollector` and `bitmovinPlayerCollector` into `testing` folder. You can do this by running the `npm run refresh-collectors` command.

Before the tests can run successfully we should add our device ip and developer password to the `package.json` file in `run-tests` script. In order to do this, please change the values for `ROKU_DEV_TARGET` and `DEVPASSWORD` to your device ip address and to your developer password.

The last step is running the tests. We should position ourselves to root of the repository and run the following command:

```bash
npm run run-tests
```

## VSCode IDE Brightscript Setup

Please install `vscode-ide-brightscript` package using `VSCode` package manager in order to have out of the box support for:

- On the fly linting and error checking
- Code snippets for common statements (`if`, `for`, `while`, `function`)
- Code region folding

### Wist Linter

Wist linter is included in the `vscode-ide-brightscript` package.
Wist linter rules can be edited by updating rules from `.wistrc.json` file which is added to the root folder of the repository.
Full list of supported rules can be found [here](https://willowtreeapps.github.io/wist/user-guide/rules/).
